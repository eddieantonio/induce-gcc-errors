# C errors

This repository induces the top 20 errors from Cormac Murray's 2019 MSc Thesis.

# How to use

You will need:

 - gcc-12
 - [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha) (to generate coloured HTML)

Then run:

    make

# Errors

This list of errors comes from ยง8.1.2 (page 92) from Cormac's thesis.
The "e" codes were invented for the purposes of the thesis. The errors
are ranked from most frequently occurring to least frequently occurring.
These are messages that appear at ANY level in the output (not just the
first error message).

I used gcc-12 on macOS, but I believe Cormac's errors come from an
Ubuntu machine -- thus linking errors will be different.

1. e1001: _`<x>` undeclared (first use in this function)._
2. e1002: _expected `<x>` before `<y>`_
3. e1007: _stray `<x>` in program_ (try `$`?)
4. e1004: _expected expression before `<x>`_
5. e1010: _unknown type name `<x>`_
6. e1005: _expected declaration or statement at end of input_
7. e1008: _expected identifier or `(` before `<x>`_
8. e1006: _expected `=`, `,`, `;`, `asm`, `__attribute__` before `<x>`_
9. e1023: _request for member in something not a structure or union_ (try `.foo`)
10. e1044: _expected declaration specifiers or '...' before `<x>`_
11. e1012: _`<x>` has no member named `<y>`_
12. e1003: _undefined reference to `<x>`_
13. e1013: _invalid type argument of `<...>`_
14. e1030: _expected `<x>` before `<...>` constant_
15. e1017: _too few arguments to function `<x>`_
16. e1011: _lvalue required as `<...>`_ (try `1 = x`?)
17. e1022: _expected declaration specifiers or '...' before `<...>` constant_
18. e1034: _expected declaration specifiers before `<x>`_
19. e1015: _missing terminating `<x>` character_ (try open character literal?)
20. e1020: _redefinition of `<x>`_

21. `<x>: No such file or directory`

# Notes

## e1034: expected declaration specifiers before 'if'

I have absolutely no idea how to get this without a cascading error. This error message can be induced by writing a statement after the function declaration, but missing the opening curly brace for a function definition.

```
18-e1034.c: In function 'main':
18-e1034.c:2:5: error: expected declaration specifiers before 'if'
    2 |     if (argc == 1)
      |     ^~
18-e1034.c:4: error: expected '{' at end of input
```

## e1003: undefined reference to `<x>`

This is a linker error, and as such, is dependent on the platform's linker. I have committed the version from a glibc-style linker.


## e1015: missing terminating " character

I cannot seem to get this without:

 1. a warning with the same message
 2. a cascading error, due to error recovery
